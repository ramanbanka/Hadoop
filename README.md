# Hadoop

	This is my personal experience repository on hadoop.
	I made this when I started to work with hadoop at MNNIT during my 3rd year.
	
	This repo contains all my previous experiences with hadoop and big data. 
	cfg contains several scripts that I made to make installation of hadoop easy.
	hadoop-streaming contains a utility that I use to write hadoop programs in python rather than in java.
	all other directories are various projects that I've worked with. Most of them are log files,website dumps and business data and not much of production data.
